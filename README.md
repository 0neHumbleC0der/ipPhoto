--- How does this Work? ---

The php code uses the fopen, fwrite, fclose in order to edit the text file where the ip will be saved.
Using the $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] captures the IP adress of the server under which the current script is executing.

Feel free to improve your own scripts and most important: SHARE!
